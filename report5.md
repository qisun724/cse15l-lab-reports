# LAB REPORT 5
## Debugging Scenario



## Reflection
I have never used vim or heard of it before, so I learned about it in class, it was very intriguing. One very cool thing that I like about it is that it allows us to create and edit files from our command line even though it can get a little confusing learning all the different key strokes for different purposes. I thought that being able to remote login to ieng6 is also cool because I get to work on the remote terminal locally on my laptop. By combining these two ideas, I think it will allow me to work on my coding assignments from any terminal on any computer.
