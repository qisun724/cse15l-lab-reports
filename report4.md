## Step 1. Log into ieng6
![Image](ssh.png)
After I delete any exisitng forks of the repository on my account, I forked the repository. Then to log into ieng6, I typed the following command into my terminal but with `zz` replaced with the last two letters in my course-specific account:`ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu`

After I press `<enter>`, it didn't prompt me to put in my password because I generated SSH key for ieng6. If it does prompt you, just copy and paste your 15l account password over to the terminal and press`<enter>`.
